## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. Create a file and open this file in your terminal. Copy the HTTPS url and paste it after the following command:

2. Move inside the myapp folder within your terminal and install all the required NPM packages through the 
`npm install`

3. Create an .env file in the root directory and define the following values for the app to actually work:
```
HOST = your host. Use localhost if running locally
PORT = your port name
DATABASE_NAME = name of your database created through MongoDB
SESSION_KEY = a random string (could be anything) for secure user sessions.
```
This could be anything. However it must match the values in the .env file.
4. Edit the user schema to fit the database suited for your project. This can be done inside the `routes/user-schema.js` file. Read up on the mongoDB docs on how to do that.
An example of a user in the current database:

2. Include the partials you want to include.
